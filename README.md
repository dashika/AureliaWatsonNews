## Get Started

- Make sure you have **NodeJS** installed
- Make sure you have **gulp** installed globally:
```shell
npm install gulp-cli -g
```
- Make sure you have **Aurelia-CLI** installed globally:
```shell
npm install aurelia-cli -g
```
- Download or clone this repository
- Enter in the **'server'** directory and run:
```shell
npm install
```
- Enter in the **'client'** directory and run:
```shell
npm install
```
```shell
jspm install -y
```
- After all dependencies are installed and your MongoBD string connection is set, enter in **'client'** directory and run:
```shell
gulp
```
- Now you can access the local website:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
- All changes to client *.ts (TypeScript) files will be listen, so you just need to wait to aurelia rebuild the bundles and reload your page
